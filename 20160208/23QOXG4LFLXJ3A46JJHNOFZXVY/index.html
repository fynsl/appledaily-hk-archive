Their conversations were of a highly informal and often joking sort. One morning when her phone rang at the accustomed time, the princess picked up the instrument and said,  "Hello, you old fool."<br>The voice of the operator broke in, saying,  "I beg your pardon, Your Royal Highness. His Majesty is not yet on the line."<br>*　　　　*　　　　*<br>Seeing his young grandson deeply engrossed in his studies, George V gave the youngster a pat on the head and asked,  "And who are you studying about now?"<br>"About Perkin Warbeck," was the reply.*<br>"And who was he?"<br>"Oh, he was just someone who pretended he was the son of a king. But he wasn't really; he was the son of respectable parents."<br>英國國王喬治五世和妹妹維多利亞公主習慣每天上午定時通電話，閑聊一下，彼此說話都十分隨便，還常開玩笑。一天早上，公主聽見電話在習慣的時間響起鈴聲，拿起來就說：「喂，老笨蛋。」<br>回答的卻是接線生的聲音：「對不起，公主，國王還未來聽電話。」<br>*　　　　*　　　　*<br>喬治五世看見小孫兒聚精匯神讀書，輕拍一下他的腦袋，問道：「你在讀誰人的事迹？」那孩子回答：「珀金．沃貝克。」*<br>「他是誰？」<br>「啊，是個冒牌王子。但他其實不是生於國王之家，而是一禮義之家。」<br>*沃貝克自稱為英王之後，十五世紀末興兵爭位，兵敗身死。</p></body></html>
