He once visited Louis ⅩⅣ in Paris, and the French monarch showed him his pictures. He finally pointed out to him a picture of the Crucifixion between two portraits.<br>"That on the right," said his Majesty,  "is the Pope, and that on the left is myself."<br>"I humbly thank you, your Majesty," replied the English court jester,  "for the information; for though I have often heard that the Lord was crucified between two thieves,* I never knew who they were till now."<br>湯瑪斯．基利格魯是十七世紀英國劇作家兼戲院經理，但他最為人樂道的，不是其戲劇，而是其詼謔。他還是查理二世的王室節慶典禮官。有一次，他到巴黎，拜謁法王路易十四。路易十四帶他參觀宮中藏畫，最後給他看一幅耶穌釘十字架圖。左右兩邊是兩幅畫像。<br>路易十四說：「右邊那幅，畫的是教宗；左邊那幅，畫的是我。」<br>那個英國王室弄臣說：「陛下，承蒙賜告，非常感謝。我常常聽到人說，主耶穌給釘在兩個強盜之間*，但現在才知道那兩個強盜是誰。」<br>*《聖經．馬太福音》第二十七章記述耶穌釘十字架的情況：「有兩個強盜，和他一起，給釘在十字架上，一個在右，一個在左。」</p></body></html>
