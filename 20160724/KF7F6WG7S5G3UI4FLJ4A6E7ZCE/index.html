When he died in  1786, he had doubled the country's area and left it rich, powerful, and more humanely governed.<br>A place hunter once asked him for the grant of some rich Protestant bishopric. The king expressed his regret that it was already given away, but said that there was a Catholic abbacy at his disposal.<br>The applicant managed to be converted in a week, and to be received into the bosom of the Catholic Church. He then hastened to his friend, the king, and told him how his conscience had been enlightened.<br>"Ah!" exclaimed Frederick,  "how terribly unfortunate! I have given away the abbacy. But the chief rabbi is just dead, and the synagogue is at my disposal. Suppose you were to turn Jew?"<br>腓特烈大帝一七四零年登上普魯士王位，到一七八六年去世，普魯士領土已擴展一倍，國家富強，政治也趨向開明。<br>有一次，一個干謁者向他求祿，盼獲委任為一富裕地區的基督徒主教。腓特烈說，有那樣一個職位，可惜已命人出任，不過，還有個天主教修道院院長職位未曾許人。<br>那干祿者一個星期之內，就改變信仰，皈依天主教。他馬上再去見他的朋友腓特烈，說自己已聞道覺迷。<br>腓特烈歎口氣說：「啊，真不巧，那修道院院長職位，我已經委與他人。不過，猶太教主教剛剛死了，猶太教堂這個空缺，還未許人。你變做猶太人，怎麼樣？」</p></body></html>
