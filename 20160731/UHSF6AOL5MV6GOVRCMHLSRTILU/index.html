"And why may I ask you is it impracticable?"<br>"Because the nation will be against you, nine out of ten at least."<br>"Very well, sir," replied Cromwell,  "but what if I should disarm the nine and put the sword into the tenth man's hand  -- would that not do the business?"*<br>奧立佛．克倫威爾率領國會軍隊，打敗英王查理一世。查理一世遭處死之後，他決定以護國公身分，獨攬大權。著名的長老會牧師愛德蒙．卡拉米不贊同，說那不但非法，也不可行。<br>克倫威爾說：「論法律，最重要的就是保衞百姓。至於你說不可行，請問為什麼不可？」<br>「因為國民會反對，至少十有九人會反對。」<br>克倫威爾回答說：「那好吧，我就要那九個人繳械，而把劍交給第十個人──這不就行了麼？」*<br>*克倫威爾一六五三年任護國公，到一六五八年去世，其子理查繼位，但翌年即被迫流亡法國。</p></body></html>
