To the proposition that he submit to treatment, however, Edison opposed an emphatic negative. "What I am afraid of," said he, "is that you would be successful. Just think of what a lot of stuff I'd have to listen to that I don't want to hear! To be a little deaf and be the only one who knows just how deaf you are has its advantages. I prefer to let well enough alone."<br>湯瑪斯．愛迪生①兩耳失聰，但他一些朋友知道，那可說是心理而不是生理上的失聰。<br>有一次，一個耳科醫師往訪愛迪生，說出一套醫療計劃，認為應可助他恢復聽覺，並提議為他治療。不過，愛迪生斷然拒絕，說道：「我擔心的，是你把我醫好。試想想，醫好之後，很多我不想聽的廢話，就不能不聽。有點兒失聰，而且只有自己才知道聽到多少，不無好處。目前情況還算不錯，何必改變。」<br>①愛迪生是美國大發明家，一九三一年去世，有千多種發明，包括電燈泡、留聲機以及電影設備。<br>②「全聾」英文或稱stone deaf（石頭般聾），因此，有人戲稱半聾（partially deaf）為sand deaf（沙子般聾），但那不是正式說法。</p></body></html>
