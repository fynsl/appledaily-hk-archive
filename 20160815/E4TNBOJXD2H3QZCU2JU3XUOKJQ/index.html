He took the aircraft* up for a short flight and was coming in to land when the commander of the base said, "Excuse me, General, but it would be better to come down on the sea; this is a flying boat." Metaxas, who had been about to put the aircraft down on a runway, swerved quickly upward, made another circuit, and touched the flying boat down safely on the surface of the sea.<br>Rising from the wheel, he said, "Thank you, Commander, for preventing me from making a stupid blunder." Thus saying, he opened the aircraft's door and stepped into the sea.<br>愛奧尼斯．美塔薩克斯將軍一九三六年開始獨裁統治希臘，直到一九三六年去世。他有一次視察地中海一空軍基地，應邀試飛新的水上飛機，在空中盤旋了一下，正準備着陸，基地指揮官說：「將軍，在海上降落會好一點。這是架水上飛機。」美塔薩克本來要在跑道上降落，這時連忙轉向上飛，再在空中繞了個圈，然後安全降落海面。<br>他在駕駛座上站起來，說道：「指揮官，謝謝你提醒，我差點犯了個愚不可及的錯誤。」他打開飛機門，一腳踏進海裏。<br>*Aircraft是航空器，包括飛機（aeroplane）、直昇機（helicopter）以至氣球（balloon）。這個字單複數形式相同，two aircraft不可寫作two aircrafts。 </p></body></html>
