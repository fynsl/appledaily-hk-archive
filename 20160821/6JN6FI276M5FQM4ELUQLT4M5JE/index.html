He would ask them whether they pursued painting out of interest or necessity. If it was the latter, he would advise them to avoid art by all means. When any young man apparently not in very good circumstances came to him for instruction, it never failed to depress him greatly, as his own early struggles were thus recalled.<br>But there was a lighter side to the painter. Once he met a lady on the street in Boston, who saluted him with,  "Ah! Mr Stuart, I have just seen your miniature, and kissed it, because it was so much like you."  "And did it kiss you in return?"  "Of course not!" she answered, laughing.  "Then," said Stuart, "it was not like me."<br>吉伯特．斯圖亞特*是美國著名肖像畫家。年輕人欲以畫藝鳴世者，不少都來找他。斯圖亞特會問他們，從事繪畫，是為興趣還是為生活。假如是為生活，斯圖亞特會勸他們切勿入行。每逢有年輕人，看來手頭拮据，走來向他討教，他就會想起從前的艱辛，心情悒怏。<br>但斯圖亞特也有輕鬆的時候。有一次，在波士頓街頭，他碰見一位女士。那女士上前打招呼說：「斯圖亞特先生，我剛才看到你的小肖像，和你像極了，就拿起來吻了一下。」「那肖像有沒有還你一吻？」那女士笑道：「當然沒有。」斯圖亞特說：「那就不像我了。」<br>*斯圖亞特卒於一八二八年，所繪華盛頓肖像，見於美國紙幣。</p></body></html>
