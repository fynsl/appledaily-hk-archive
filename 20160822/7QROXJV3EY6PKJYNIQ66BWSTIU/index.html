The latter lived in a very small, unpretentious house, scarcely in keeping with his position in the Church.<br>One day when Father Ryan was passing the house of the archbishop, accompanied by a Chicago priest who was visiting St Louis, he pointed out the house as the residence of the head of the local church. The Chicago priest said in surprise, "Why, you should see the splendid residence we have in Chicago for our archbishop!"<br>"Yes," said Father Ryan,  "but you should see the splendid archbishop we have in St Louis for our residence."<br>派屈克．瑞安一八八四年出任費城大主教，直到一九一一年去世。他還是個年輕教士的時候，曾在聖路易市一個教區供職，屬肯德里克大主教轄區。這位大主教居住的房子，小而樸素，和他在教會的地分絕不相稱。<br>有一天，瑞安神父和芝加哥來的一位教士同行，路過那棟小房子，指着對那教士說，這是當地教會領袖的住所。那教士愕然說道：「啊，你該看看我們在芝加哥那座美不勝收的大主教府。」<br>瑞安神父說：「不錯，但你也該看看我們在聖路易那位美不勝收的大主教。」</p></body></html>
