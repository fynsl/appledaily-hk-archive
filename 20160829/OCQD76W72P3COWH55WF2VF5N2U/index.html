He was just about to turn away when the covering was removed and there revealed one of Terborch's ② masterpieces which Sir William had failed to gain some time previously, though he had offered  £6,000 for it.<br>"My name is Wallace," said the man quietly, "Sir William Wallace."<br>有一天，一個衣著頗見殘舊的人，腋下挾着一幅畫，走到倫敦國立美術館，要見館長威廉．博克索爾爵士，幾經峻拒，才獲許和館長稍會片刻，說有一幅畫，想送給美術館。他正要解下封帶，展示封蓋下的畫圖，博克索爾爵士卻說沒空觀看，着他把畫放下，否則帶回家算了。博克索爾爵士正要轉過身去，封蓋已經打開，露出泰爾博赫的一幅傑作。博克索爾爵士曾出價六千英鎊購買這幅畫，卻買不到。<br>送畫者平靜的說：「我叫華利士：威廉．華利士爵士。」<br>①威廉．博克索爾生於一八零零年，卒於一八七九年。<br>②泰爾博赫是十七世紀荷蘭著名畫家。</p></body></html>
