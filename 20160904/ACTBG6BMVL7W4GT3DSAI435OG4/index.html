His team had been badly trounced in the first half of one of their big games. The interval between halves was one of silence and gloom in which the coach said nothing.<br>At last, as the team prepared to go out again on the field, he looked them over slowly and deliberately and said,  "Well, girls, shall we go?"<br>They won the game.<br>＊    ＊    ＊<br>A football game took place in Belfast between Catholics and Protestants. An Englishman attended that game, and when the Catholics made a skilful play he applauded and when the Protestants in their turn scored he again joined in the shouting. An Irishman jabbed him in the back and said,  "My God, man, haven't you got any religion at all?"<br>達納．拜布爾是德州農工學院足球教練，其振奮士氣講詞，在近代足球史上，應是最為沉着簡短，並最有成效。他的球隊參與一場重要比賽，上半場慘敗。中場休息期間，球員都垂頭喪氣，相對無言。拜布爾一言不發。<br>到準備再出場的時候，拜布爾緩緩上下端詳各球員，然後說：「各位姑娘，現在出去好嗎？」<br>他的球隊終於得勝。<br>＊    ＊    ＊<br>貝爾法斯特一場足球比賽，天主教徒對基督教徒。一個英國人觀賽，見天主教徒表現出色，會叫好；見基督教徒進球得分，也和他人一起喝采。一個愛爾蘭人用手一戳他背部，說道：「老兄，你連宗教信仰都沒有嗎？」</p></body></html>
