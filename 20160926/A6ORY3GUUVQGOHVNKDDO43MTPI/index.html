"All right then," said Gilbert in answer to their protests.  "Let us take this passage for example:  'I would as lief be thrust through a quickset hedge, / As cry plosh to a callow throstle.' "<br>"Why, that's perfectly clear," insisted one of his hearers, rising to the defence of the Bard.② "  It just means that this bird lover would rather get himself all scratched up in the thorny bush than disturb the bird's song. What play is the passage from?"<br>"No play," said Gilbert,  "I made it up - and jolly good Shakespeare too."<br>歌劇作家威廉.吉柏特①有一次上加立克俱樂部，輕詆莎士比亞，語驚四座。吉柏特見他人不贊同其言，就說：「好吧，謹試引一段為例：『我寧擠荊棘樹籬，不願向黃口畫眉鳥高喊：喝！』」<br>一人為詩豪莎士比亞辯護，力言：「這並不難明白，意思是那愛鳥之人，寧願身犯荊棘叢，遍體刺傷，都不願驚擾鳥兒歌唱。這段話引自那齣戲劇？」<br>吉柏特說：「那不是引自任何一齣莎劇，而是我杜撰的，也是很不錯的莎士比亞式文字。」<br>①吉柏特是著名英國喜劇作家，卒於一九一一年。<br>②Bard是「詩人」，莎士比亞有the Bard（of Avon）之譽，Stratford-on-Avon是其出生地。</p></body></html>
