There is the story of the sergeant who was training a bunch of recruits on a rifle range.<br>At a hundred yards the order to fire was given.   After the smoke had cleared away, the target was revealed as smooth and untouched.<br>The sergeant gave the order to move up to fifty yards.  Again the firing order was given.  And still the target was untouched. They moved up to twenty-five yards--with the same results.<br>Ordering the recruits to close ranks, the sergeant, red-faced and seemingly about to burst, bellowed: "Fix bayonets and charge!"<br>中士對待新兵嚴格，未必不對。有一個故事，說一名中士在靶場訓練一群新兵。<br>他下令新兵在一百碼之外開槍。硝煙散後，可以看見靶子平滑無損，沒有中彈。<br>中士命令士兵向前走五十碼，再下令開槍，靶子仍是絲毫無損。他們再向前走二十五碼，結果還是一樣。<br>中士漲紅了臉，似乎肺將氣炸。他下令新兵聚集起來，大吼一聲：「上刺刀，向前衝！」<br>*Rookie是美國俚語，應是從recruit一字演變而成，指軍隊、警隊、球隊等的新人，多用在另一名詞之前，例如a rookie cop（新招募的警察）。</p></body></html>
