When Sinclair began to speak, a police captain shouted to him,  "I'm taking you in if you utter a word."  "My right to speak is protected by the US constitution," Sinclair replied. He had just read part of the First Amendment  -- the part about freedom of speech and the right of  "the people peaceably to assemble"  -- the police captain grabbed him by the collar and arrested him, saying,  "We'll have none of that constitution stuff!"<br>Sinclair was not allowed to consult an attorney, and was not released from jail until two days later.*<br>一九二二年，美國著名小說家厄普頓．辛克雷爾為支持工人言論自由，在聖佩德羅海運罷工集會上致辭。是次罷工，令約九十艘船滯留洛杉磯港口。辛克雷爾開始致辭時，一個警察隊長向他高喊：「你說一句話，就把你拘捕。」辛克雷爾回答說：「我說話的權利，獲美國憲法保障。」他讀出美國憲法第一修正案，即關於言論自由以及「人民和平集會」權利的條文，還未讀完，那警察隊長就抓住他衣領，把他逮捕，說道：「我們不要什麼憲法的廢話！」<br>辛克雷爾在獄中過了兩天才獲釋，其間不准見律師。*<br>*辛克雷爾不因「尋釁滋事」罪判處入獄十年或二十年，拘留期間也不因「心臟病發」而死，是九十年前美國留下的奇聞。</p></body></html>
