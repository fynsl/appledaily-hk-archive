Lincoln was urged by his advisors not to accept it as  "Secretary Chase is today a national necessity".<br>"How mistaken you are!" Lincoln observed.  "Yet it is not strange; I used to have similar notions. No! If we should all be turned out tomorrow and could come back here in a week, we should find our places filled by a lot of fellows doing just as well as we did, and in many instances better. In this country, one man is as good as another. This government does not depend upon the life of any man."*<br>西門．蔡斯在林肯政府擔任財政部長，和內閣其他成員不協，於是辭職。林肯的幕僚勸他拒絕蔡斯的辭呈，說「國家今天不可沒有蔡斯部長」。<br>林肯說：「各位真是大錯特錯，但這不奇怪，我從前也有類似的想法。事實並非如此。假如我們明天都給攆走，一個星期之後回來，當會發覺已有他人接任我們的工作，而且表現不比我們差，甚或往往比我們好。在這個國家，誰都不比別人優勝。我們的政府，不會倚仗任何一個人。」*<br>*美國人顯然都是庸才，不似新中國，巨人輩出，所以前有「人民的大救星」毛主席，今有「人民的大福星」習主席。今天啊，沒有了習主席，中國怎麼辦啊，中國人怎麼辦啊，世界以及世人怎麼辦啊！</p></body></html>
