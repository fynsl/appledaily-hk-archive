The post of such legitimate importance degenerated through the years into a political plum.* At last, after one election, it fell into the hands of an appointee of utter incompetence, who shortly after taking office was shocked to learn that he must make a monthly report.  He submitted thereupon the following:  "Have inspected the smoke of St Louis for the month of December, and have found it to be of good quality."<br>美國密蘇里州聖路易斯市一度頑煙為患，污染空氣。一九三九年，該市一場煙霧九天不散，尤其嚴重，路燈須整天亮着。<br>該市有一煙督察辦事處。這督察職位，無疑重要非常，但是，久而久之，淪為政客的肥缺。一次選舉之後，這職位落在一庸夫手上。他上任不久，驚悉每個月須寫報告，惟有呈交報告如下：「聖路易斯市十二月之煙霧驗訖。其質素優良。」<br>*Plum是李子，其味甚甘，因此常用以比喻工作輕鬆而待遇優厚的職位，即a plum job，例如：He landed a plum job, with a handsome salary and generous fringe benefits（他獲得一個肥缺，薪水優渥，福利豐厚）。</p></body></html>
