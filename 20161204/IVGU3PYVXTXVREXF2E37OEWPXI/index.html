In one of the rooms, roped off from curious hands, is the piano upon which Beethoven composed many of his great works.<br>A Michigan girl, visiting the shrine with a party of American students, looked upon the instrument with awe and asked the guard, with the additional persuader of a generous tip, if she might play on it for a moment. The permission was granted and she sat at the piano and strummed out a few bars of the  "Moonlight Sonata".<br>Departing, she remarked to the guard,  "I suppose all the great pianists who have come here at one time or another have played on it." The guard said,  "No, Miss, Paderewski* was here two years ago but said he was not worthy to touch it."<br>波昂的貝多芬故居現已改為紀念博物館，其中一個房間裏，有鋼琴，用繩圍繞，以免參觀者觸摸。貝多芬在這琴上譜寫了不少傑作。<br>一群美國學生到這聖地參觀，同行有一密西根州少女。她望着那鋼琴，心生崇敬，問守衞員可不可讓她稍彈一下，並慷慨奉贈能動人心的小費，於是獲准坐在琴前，彈了《月光》奏鳴曲幾小節。<br>她離去時，跟那守衞員說：「歷來到訪的大鋼琴家，都彈過這鋼琴吧。」那守衞員回答：「小姐，這話不對。兩年前，帕岱瑞夫斯基*蒞臨，卻自言碰碰這鋼琴都不配。」<br>*帕岱瑞夫斯基是波蘭鋼琴家，卒於一九四一年。</p></body></html>
