A number of American officers being introduced in tattered uniforms, and barefoot, the question was put to them severally:  "What was your trade before you entered the army?"  One answered a tailor, another a cobbler, etc. The wit of the piece was to banter them for not keeping themselves in clothes and shoes.<br>But before that could be expressed, the American exclaimed form the gallery:  "Great Britain beaten by tailors and cobblers! Hurrah!"<br>Even the prime minister, who was present, could not help smiling, amidst a general peal of laughter.<br>美國獨立戰爭之後不久，美國一個少年在英國劇院看戲。演戲期間，加插了一段表演，是嘲諷美國人的。首先，一些美國軍官出場，軍服襤褸，赤着雙脚。有人向他們一一詢問：「閣下從軍之前，從事什麼職業？」一個說是裁縫，一個說是鞋匠等等。這段演出，意在嘲諷他們衣履都不能自給。<br>但是，這意思還未表達，樓座就傳出那美國少年一聲高喊：「了不起！大英帝國敗在裁縫、鞋匠手上！」<br>觀眾哄堂大笑，連在座的英國首相都忍不住笑起來。</p></body></html>
