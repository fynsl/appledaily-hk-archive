She was telling him where she had dined the day before.  "There were several gentlemen there," said she,  "and I found that there had been a great deal of hard drinking."  She closed this observation with a moral reflection:  "I wonder what pleasure men can take in making beasts of themselves."<br>Dr Johnson replied,  "I wonder madam that you have not the penetration to see that he who makes a beast of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man."<br>*　*　*<br>When conversation in a company in which Dr Johnson was present had fallen upon rather a delicate topic, one of the ladies, with an expression of great displeasure, rose and left the room.  "That woman," said the doctor,  "is the most immodest of all the company."<br>有一天，約翰生博士*和他失明的朋友威廉斯太太閒談。威廉斯太太談到前一天去某處吃飯：「那兒有幾個男人，都喝了很多酒。」她的結語帶道德意味：「男人買醉，醉後只餘禽畜之性，真不知何樂之有。」<br>約翰生博士說：「奇怪，你怎麼看不到，只餘禽畜之性，就可擺脫做人的痛苦。」<br>*　*　*<br>一群人聚談，談到通常諱言的一件事，一個女士怫然站起，走出房間。約翰生博士在座，說話：「這個女人，是我們之中心靈最不純潔者。」<br>*約翰生是英國著名辭典編纂家，一七八四年去世。</p></body></html>
