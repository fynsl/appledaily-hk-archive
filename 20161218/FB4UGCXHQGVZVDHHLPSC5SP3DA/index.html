In  1779, when he was just  13 years old, he was captured by the British, and nearly starved to death in captivity. When he refused to obey a command to clean a British officer's boots, he was hit across his face with the side of a saber, leaving him with a large scar on his forehead.<br>Jackson was able to take his revenge on the British in the Anglo-American War of  1812 to  1815.*  When the British forces threatened New Orleans, he took command of the defences. The battles with the superior British force ultimately resulted in an unexpected victory for the United States and ensured Jackson's status as a national hero.<br>美國獨立戰爭期間，日後將成為美國總統的安德魯．傑克遜，協助地方民兵，給他們做信差。一七七九年，他才十三歲，被英軍俘虜，在囚時幾乎餓死。有一次，他由於不聽命令，拒為一英國軍官清潔皮靴，被人用軍刀扁平面打在臉上，額頭因此留下一個大傷疤。<br>一八一二年到一八一五年英美戰爭之中*，傑克遜總算向英軍報了仇。當時英軍進犯新奧爾良，傑克遜指揮守城戰，和實力較強的英軍戰鬥多場，終於為美國贏得出乎意料的勝利，更成為國家英雄。<br>*一八一二年戰爭的起因，是英國襲擊拿破崙戰爭期間中立的美國船隻。美國幾場海戰勝利，加上新奧爾良之捷，振起美國軍威。</p></body></html>
