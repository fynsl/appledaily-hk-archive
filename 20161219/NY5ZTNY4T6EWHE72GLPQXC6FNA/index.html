In South Africa, he was travelling with a soldier friend aboard a train carrying English troops that was ambushed and derailed by the Boers. Churchill was taken as a prisoner of war.<br>Although treated well by his captors, Churchill hated every minute of his captivity. So, after unsuccessfully appealing his capture on the grounds that he was a noncombatant, Churchill escaped from prison. Before escaping, however, he courteously left a letter of apology on his bed, addressed to the Boer secretary of war. The letter ended by saying: “Regretting that I am unable to bid you a more ceremonious or a personal farewell, I have the honour to be, Sir, your most obedient servant, Winston Churchill.”<br>一八九九年十月，邱吉爾以報紙專欄作家身分，赴南非實地觀察波爾人的獨立戰爭。在南非，他和一位從軍友人一起，乘搭一列運送英軍的火車。火車遭波爾人伏擊出軌，邱吉爾被擒，成為戰俘。<br>邱吉爾獲波爾人善待，但身為階下囚，非常不快。他向有司請求釋放，原因是自己並非戰鬥人員，但不獲准許，於是越獄而去。越獄之前，他禮貌十足，在牀上放下道歉書，留奉波爾戰爭部長。信末說：「未能依足禮節或趨謁崇階，向先生道別，深以為憾。至忠僕人邱吉爾百拜。」</p></body></html>
