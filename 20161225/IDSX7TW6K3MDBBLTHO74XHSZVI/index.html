The collaboration was difficult.  Stein posed no fewer than  80 times, after which Picasso wiped the face clean, and declared that he could not  "see" her anymore.  Some time later, he completed the work without a sitter, and presented the portrait to Stein, who complained that she looked nothing like the figure in the painting.   "No," replied Picasso.  "But you will."  His prediction was later borne out.<br>Many years later, the millionaire art collector Albert Barnes asked Stein what she had paid for the portrait.  "Nothing," she replied.  "He gave it to me."  Barnes was stunned. When Picasso heard this, he remarked,  "Barnes doesn't understand that at that time the difference between a sale and a gift was negligible."<br>一九零六年，美國作家葛楚德．斯坦茵請畢加索給她畫像，但畫者和被畫者無法配合，斯坦茵擺姿勢不下八十次，最後，畢加索把所畫面孔抹去，說再也不能「見」她。過了一段日子，他不用模特兒，把肖像畫好，交給斯坦茵。斯坦茵抱怨畫中人和她毫不相似，畢加索回答說：「是不相似，不過，你將來就會是這樣子。」事實證明他說對了。<br>多年之後，富翁兼藝術收藏家阿伯特．巴恩斯問斯坦茵，請畢加索畫像，花了多少錢。斯坦茵說：「一文不用，是他送給我的。」巴恩斯大感意外。後來，畢加索聽到這件事，說道：「巴恩斯不知道，那時候，我的畫是賣是送，沒有什麼分別。」</p></body></html>
