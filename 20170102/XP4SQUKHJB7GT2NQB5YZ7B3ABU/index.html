Morita von Kotzebue, author of</em>   Narrative of a Journey into Persia,  <em> relates the following anecdote of him:</em> <br>The Russian ambassador perceived in the garden belonging to the prince a projecting corner of an old wall, which made a very ugly contrast with the rest, and disfigured the prospect. He asked Abbas Mirza why he did not have it pulled down.<br>"I have bought this garden from several proprietors in order to make something magnificent," replied the prince.  "The proprietor of the place where the wall projects is an old peasant, who positively refused to sell me his piece of land, it being an old family possession. I honour him for his attachment to his forefathers, and still more for his boldness in refusing it me."*<br><em> 波斯皇太子阿巴斯．米爾札不但善戰，而且身修行美，一八三三年去世，比父親早逝。《波斯遊記》作者莫里茨．馮．科策布記錄了他以下一件事：</em> <br>俄國大使見到皇太子的花園，有一角舊牆突出，與其他部分並不匹配。十分難看，破壞了園景。他問皇太子為什麼不拆掉那舊牆。<br>皇太子回答說：「這個花園，我從幾個業主手上買來，有心修築得美輪美奐。那道突出舊牆，所屬土地的業主是個老農夫。他斷然拒絕賣地給我，因為那是他祖宗歷代相傳的。我敬重他對先人的依戀，更敬重他不賣地給我的勇氣。」*<br>*那勇氣，在新中國，應屬貪污或滋事罪，可判處監禁十年零六個月，如烏坎村民魏永漢。</p></body></html>
