Lincoln asked why he did not join the army.<br>The man said,  "I would but they probably wouldn't take me, otherwise I would be glad to die for my country."<br>Lincoln took a piece of paper from his hat, wrote a note, folded it, and gave it to the man, saying,  "Give it to the officer at the front of the White House and then return to me.  I'll be around for a while."<br>The man never returned, nor did he go to the White House.  The note said, "Col Fielding, the bearer is anxious to go to the front and die for his country.  Can't you give him a chance?"<br>美國內戰期間，林肯有一天和國務卿威廉．蘇厄德一起在路上走。一個男人，看來頗為壯健，上前求施捨。林肯問他為什麼不參軍。<br>那人說：「我也想參軍，但恐怕當局不容我入伍。要不然，我樂意為國捐軀。」<br>林肯從帽子裏取出一張紙，寫下數語，摺起來，交給那人，說道：「拿這個到白宮，交給前庭那位軍官，然後回來找我。我會在這裏逗留一會兒。」<br>那人沒有回來，也沒有去白宮。那字條寫的是：「費爾丁上校：送便條者，盼赴前線，為國捐軀，可以成全他的願望嗎？」</p></body></html>
