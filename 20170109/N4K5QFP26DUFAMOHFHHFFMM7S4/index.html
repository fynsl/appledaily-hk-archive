Harte corrected the mistake thinking it sufficient to refer the compositor back to the original copy by a large query in the margin.  To his horror, the following day the paper appeared with the statement:  "She was distinguished for chastity (?) above all the other ladies in this town."<br>布雷特．哈特是美國著名短篇小說作家，一九零二年去世。他在加州一採礦城市擔任報紙編輯期間，嘗為一位深受尊崇的婦人撰寫訃聞，結尾一句是：「其慈善之情，本市婦女界無有倫比者。」<br>訃文的校樣送來時，哈特發覺排字工人把他寫的charity（慈善之情）誤作拼法相似的chastity（貞潔之情）：「其貞潔之情，本市婦女界無有倫比者。」他在校樣一側打個大問號，以為排字工人見到，當會參看原稿更正。第二天，他讀報，看到以下一句，不禁目瞪口呆：「其貞潔之情（？），本市婦女界無有倫比者。」</p></body></html>
