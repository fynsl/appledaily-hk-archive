The prince was so angry that he rushed into court and commanded that his servant should be set at liberty.<br>The Chief Justice, Sir William Gascoigne, mildly reminded the prince of the reverence which was due to the Kingdom's laws, but the prince turned towards the prisoner and attempted to take him by force out of the hands of the officers. Thereupon the Chief Justice committed him to prison. His father, Henry  Ⅳ, was no sooner informed of this than he exclaimed in a transport of joy, "Happy is the king who has a magistrate possessed of courage to execute the laws."<br>The prince himself, when he came to be king, said,  "I shall ever hold Sir William worthy of his place."*<br>英王亨利五世還是威爾斯王子的時候，有個寵僕，因行為不檢，被定罪。王子憤然直闖法庭，下令把他釋放。<br>首席法官威廉．加斯科因爵士心平氣和，提醒王子須尊重國家法律，王子卻轉身走向犯人，要強行把他從法庭人員手中帶走。加斯科因於是把王子送入監獄。王子的父親亨利四世聽到這件事，欣然說：「朕有法官勇於執法，可喜可賀。」<br>王子登基之後，也說：「我認為，加斯科因爵士非常稱職。」*<br>*亨利五世死於一四二二年，未有機會見識新中國太子黨、高幹等等「超然於法律之上」的實例。</p></body></html>
