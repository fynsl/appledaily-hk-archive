A vast crowd of people was gathered around to witness the proud spectacle, when a woman called out,  "To Trajan I appeal for justice."<br>Although the emperor was pressed by the affairs of an urgent war, he instantly stopped, alighted from his horse, and heard the woman state her grievances.  She was a poor widow, and had been left with an only son, who had been murdered.  She had sued for justice on his murderers, but had been unable to obtain it. Trajan, having satisfied himself of the truth of her statements, decreed the satisfaction she demanded, and sent her away comforted.*<br>羅馬皇帝圖拉真卒於公元一一七年。有一次，他率領大軍出羅馬城，軍容赫赫，將伐瓦拉吉亞公國，四周觀者如堵。一個女人突然高喊：「我要向圖拉真求雪冤。」<br>圖拉真雖然戎事急迫，仍然停下來，翻身下馬，聽那女人訴冤。原來她是個貧困寡婦，有獨子遭謀殺，向法庭求懲處兇手，卻未能如願。圖拉真聽了她的供詞，斷定所言不虛，就下令給她雪冤。那寡婦感激不已，辭謝而去。*<br>*新中國也有一個故事：二零一五年六月，習近平赴貴州遵義了解民情，夾道歡呼者之中，有小婦人突然高喊：「救救我，習主席……」她馬上被人掩口扼頸，拖將離去。</p></body></html>
