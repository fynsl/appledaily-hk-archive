"No, little boy," said the bank man, "I don't want a little boy." He watched the young man walk out and, stopping suddenly, stoop to pick up something from the sidewalk. It was a pin, which the young man carefully stuck in his ragged jacket. For this the bank man took him into partnership, and made him his son-in-law.<br>So Twain spent six weeks picking up pins he had surreptitiously strewn about in front of a bank. Finally, he succeeded in catching the attention of the bank man. "Little boy, what's that you're picking up?" "Pins," replied Twain hopefully. The bank man asked for the pins, and then looking at them said, "These pins belong to the bank, and if I catch you hanging around here any more, I'll set the dogs on you."<br>馬克．吐溫初出道的時候，受到伯父說的一個故事壠發。話說一個少年走進一家銀行，問道：「先生，要聘請服務生嗎？」銀行老闆說：「不要，我不聘請小孩子。」他目送那少年離去，卻見他忽然停下來，俯身拾起人行道上一件東西，小心翼翼插在破舊的夾克上，原來是一口大頭針。銀行老闆因此招那少年作生意夥伴，還招為女婿。<br>於是，吐溫花了六個星期，在一家銀行門前先暗暗撒些大頭針，然後拾起來。銀行老闆終於注意到他，問道：「小夥子，你在拾什麼？」吐溫滿懷希望，回答說：「大頭針！」銀行老闆把大頭針要過來，看了看，說道：「這些大頭針是銀行的。假如我見到你再在這裏徘徊，就放狗咬你。」</p></body></html>
