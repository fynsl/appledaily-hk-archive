Lord Wellington, happening to ride past, overheard the remark and said,  "Give me at least the prefix of  'Mr'  before my name!"  "My lord,"  said the quick-witted officer,  "we do not speak of  'Mr Caesar'  or  'Mr Alexander',  so why should I speak of  'Mr Wellington'?"  Wellington had nothing to say to that.<br>*　　*　　*<br>Wellington once purchased a farm contiguous to his estate.  His steward congratulated him on having had such a bargain, as the seller was in difficulties and obliged to part with it.  "It was valued at  £1,100, and we have got it for  £800,"  he said.  <br>"In that case, please take this extra  £300 to the late owner,"  said Wellington, giving the money to the steward.<br>西班牙一場戰役之後，一愛爾蘭軍官說：「我今晚將與威靈頓一起進餐。」威靈頓勳爵剛巧騎馬走過，聽到這句話，說道：「我名字之後，請至少加『先生』兩字。」那軍官十分機智，回答說：「勳爵，我們不會說『凱撒先生』或『亞歷山大先生』，然則為什麼要說『威靈頓先生』？」威靈頓無詞以對。<br>*　　*　　*<br>有一次，威靈頓買了鄰接其莊園的一個農場，管家恭賀他買得便宜：賣方是因為陷入困境，才不得不把農場賣掉。管家說：「農場本來估計值一千一百鎊，我們現在八百鎊就買到了。」<br>威靈頓拿出三百鎊，交給管家，說道：「那麼，請你把這額外三百鎊拿去給農場舊主人。」</p></body></html>
