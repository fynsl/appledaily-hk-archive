For a long time they did not speak when they encountered each other outside.<br>It chanced one day that they found themselves confronted by each other at a very narrow point created by repairs under way on the sidewalk.  They stood silently for a moment, faced by the question of who was to step aside and let the other pass.<br>At last Randolph said haughtily,  "I never make way for scoundrels."<br>"I always do,"  said Clay, stepping politely out into the mud, giving Randolph the right of way.*<br>美國國會議員亨利．克萊和約翰．藍多夫在參議院內，激烈吵了一場。此後，兩人國會之外相遇，互不理睬，長期如是。<br>有一天，由於人行道正在修理，他們不巧相逢於狹路，兩人一言不發，相對而立，都在想誰應站到一旁，讓對方走過。<br>最後，藍多夫傲然說：「我從來不讓路給流氓。」<br>克萊說：「我剛剛相反。」他一副彬彬有禮樣子，站到一旁的泥濘上，讓藍多夫走過。<br>*Right of way可以指交通上的先行權，也可指私有土地上的通行權，例如：There is a public right of way through the private housing estate（公眾有權在這私人屋邨裏走過）。</p></body></html>
