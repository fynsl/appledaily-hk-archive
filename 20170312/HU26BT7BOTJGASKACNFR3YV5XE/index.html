His funeral was very largely attended.<br>"If General--had known how big a funeral he would have had," said Lincoln,  "he would have died years ago."<br>✽　✽　✽<br>Henry IV, King of England from  1399 to  1413, enacted some sumptuary laws, prohibiting the use of gold and jewels in dress, but they were for some time ineffectual.<br>He then passed a supplement to them, which completely answered his purpose.  In this last he exempted from the prohibitions of the former after one month, all prostitutes and pickpockets.
