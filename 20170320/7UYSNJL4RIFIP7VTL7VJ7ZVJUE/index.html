If you felt it, you would tell us to fight for it, not with spears only, but with axes."<br>*　　　　　*　　　　　*<br>A popular joke during World War Ⅱ was that, at a stream on the Swiss frontier, a Swiss and a Nazi were fishing from the opposite sides of the water.  The Swiss caught one fish after another, whereas the Nazi did not have so much as a nibble.<br>"Why is it," called the German across the water,  "that you have so much better luck?"<br>"Well," said the Swiss,  "on this side the fish aren't afraid to open their mouths."<br>波斯使者勸斯巴達人向澤克西斯稱臣*，斯巴達人回答說：「先生只知道為奴為僕，自由的滋味，從未得嘗，因此，不可能明白稱臣的含義。先生假如嘗過自由，當會教我輩為自由而戰，即使沒有長矛，執起斧頭都要作戰到底。」<br>*　　　　　*　　　　　*<br>第二次世界大戰期間，有一個流行笑話：瑞士邊境一條小河兩岸，一個瑞士人和一個納粹黨徒相對垂釣。那瑞士人釣得一條又一條魚，那納粹黨徒的魚餌，卻連一條魚都沒有游過去咬咬。<br>那德國人隔河說道：「為什麼你的運氣勝過我那麼多？」<br>瑞士人回答說：「因為河水這邊的魚，不害怕開口。」<br>*澤克西斯是公元前五世紀波斯王，曾率大軍征希臘，折戟沉沙。</p></body></html>
