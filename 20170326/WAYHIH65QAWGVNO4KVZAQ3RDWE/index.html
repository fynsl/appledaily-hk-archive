One day he was showing his guests about, pointing out the various labour-saving devices on the premises.  Turning back towards the house it was necessary to pass through a turnstile which led onto the main path.  The guests soon found out that it took considerable force to get through this device.<br>"Mr Edison,"  asked one of his guests,  "how is it that with all these wonderful modern things around, you still maintain such a heavy turnstile?"<br>Said Edison, his eyes lighting up with laughter,  "Well, you see, everyone who pushes the turnstile around, pumps eight gallons of water into the tank on my roof."<br>愛迪生有一幢夏季別墅，美輪美奐，引以自豪。有一天，他帶着一些賓客四處參觀，一一介紹別墅之內各種節省勞力設備，然後掉頭走回房子去，途中須經過攔着主徑的十字轉杆。賓客發覺，要走過去，得使勁才能把轉杆推動。<br>一個賓客說：「愛迪生先生，你這裏處處都是奇妙的現代設備，怎麼卻還使用這樣沉重的十字轉杆？」<br>愛迪生兩眼露出笑意，回答說：「啊，凡推杆而過者，都給我屋頂的水槽泵入八加侖水。」</p></body></html>
