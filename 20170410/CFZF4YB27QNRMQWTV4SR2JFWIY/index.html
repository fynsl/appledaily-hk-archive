Bismarck answered,  "Oh, I have an infallible method.  My servant appears to inform me that my wife has something urgent to tell me."  At that moment there was a knock at the door and the servant entered with a message from his wife.<br>*      *      *<br>Bismarck, a stickler for formality, was once seated at dinner next to a young, ebullient American lady.
