On  4 May  1897, she was presiding over a charity bazaar in Paris when the hall accidentally caught fire.  Flames spread to the paper decorations and flimsy walls of the booths and in seconds the place was an inferno.<br>In the hideous panic that followed many women and children were trampled underfoot as they rushed for the exits, while workmen from a nearby site performed incredible acts of heroism, rushing into the blaze to carry out the trapped women.  Some rescuers reached the duchess, who had remained seated behind her booth.  Rejecting their offer of help, she said,  "Because of my title, I was the first to enter here.  I shall be the last to go out."  She stayed and was burned to death, along with more than  120 others.<br>蘇菲．夏樂蒂公爵夫人是法國國王路易──菲力普的親戚。一八九七年五月四日，她在巴黎主持慈善義賣會，會堂突然失火，紙製裝飾品及攤位輕薄的隔間給燒着，四處頓成火海。<br>在場者倉皇往外逃生，不少婦孺給踩在腳下。鄰近一工地的工人非常英勇，衝進火場，救出被困婦女。有拯救者來到夏樂蒂跟前。她坐在攤位裏，沒有離開，並拒絕拯救者援助，說道：「我是公爵夫人，所以得率先進場，也應是最後一個離去。」她留下不走，終於燒死，其他死者有一百二十餘人。*<br>*一九九四年十二月，新疆克拉馬依市教育局迎賓遊藝會失火，主辦者臨危不亂，吩咐在座學生：「讓領導人先走！」學生燒死者有二百八十八人。</p><p>緊貼「蘋果VR」熱潮，打開雙眼隨意門，讓「蘋果VR」陪您探索新世界： https://goo.gl/b5RQAB <br> <br>「蘋果VR」App<br>App store下載： https://goo.gl/0kW2cK <br>Google Play下載： https://goo.gl/4K7EHw  </p></body></html>
