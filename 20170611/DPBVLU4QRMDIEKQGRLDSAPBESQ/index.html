Yet he protected from the Gestapo a Jew, Dr Eduard Bloch, who lived in his home town of Linz in Austria.<br>Hitler never forgot the kindness Bloch showed his mother when he treated her for breast cancer. Because of the Hitler family's poor economic situation, Bloch charged reduced fees, sometimes taking no fee at all. Hitler's mother died in  1907, when he was  18.<br>After Germany's annexation of Austria in  1938, Hitler put Bloch under protection, and Bloch was allowed to leave for the United States in  1941. He died there in  1945.<br>According to files detailing Bloch's interrogation by American intelligence agents, when Hitler was told that his mother had contracted cancer, he showed great grief. Said Bloch, "Only then did I realise the magnitude of the attachment that existed between mother and son."<br>希特勒以反猶太人為一大任務，不過，有一個猶太人卻獲他庇護，免遭蓋世太保毒手。他就是愛德華．布洛赫醫生，居於奧地利林茲市，即希特勒的故鄉。<br>布洛赫為希特勒的母親治乳癌，仁愛為懷，令希特勒永誌不忘。由於希特勒家貧，他減收診金，有時甚至一文不受。希特勒母親一九零七年去世，當時希特勒十八歲。<br>一九三八年，德國吞併奧地利，希特勒特予布洛赫庇護。一九四一年，布洛赫獲准移居美國，一九四五年在美國去世。<br>美國情報人員曾經查問布洛赫。根據檔案所錄查問詳情，希特勒聽到母親患癌症，十分悲傷。布洛赫說：「我這時才知道他們母子感情非常深厚。」</p></body></html>
