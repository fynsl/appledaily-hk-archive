When he reached the campus a crowd of students gathered, and he started shaking hands.  As he went down the line, he took the hand of a bearded fellow who, as Ford continued shaking hands, began to smile.  It was Jack.  He had grown such a crop of whiskers that his father did not recognise him.<br>*　　　　*　　　　*<br>One day Vikki Carr, an attractive singer of Mexican ancestry, entertained at a White House dinner.  At the end of the evening, when President Ford escorted her out to the front portico, she asked,  "What's your favourite Mexican dish?"  "You are,"  said Ford, smiling.  "That woman will never get into the White House again!"  cried the First Lady, who overheard the remark.<br>美國副總統福特*有一次赴俄勒岡州，途經猶他州立大學，就去看他的兒子傑克，去到校園，見一群學生來迎，排列成行，就一面跟他們一一握手，一面向前走，走到一個留了鬍鬚的小夥子跟前，照樣伸手相握，那小夥子不禁笑起來。原來他就是傑克，由於長了濃密的頰鬚，連福特都未能認出他。<br>*　　　　*　　　　*<br>有一天，迷人的墨西哥裔歌手維基．卡爾在白宮晚宴上表演。宴會之後，福特送她往前門廊。她問：「你喜歡吃什麼墨西哥菜？」福特微笑道：「那道菜叫維基．卡爾。」福特夫人聽到這句話，高聲說：「那個女人永遠不會再到白宮！」<br>*福特一九七四年至一九七七年任美國總統。</p></body></html>
