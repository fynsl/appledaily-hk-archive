In January  1918, he issued his Fourteen Points as a basis for peace, stressing the need for a League of Nations.*<br>According to a popular story, when Wilson died in  1924 and went to heaven, he met Moses.  "You are Mr Woodrow Wilson, are you not?"  asked Moses.  "I am."  "I am very sorry for you," said Moses.  "Why so?"  asked Wilson.  "Because they have done such dreadful things to your Fourteen Points."  "For the matter of that,"  returned Wilson,  "I should advise you to go back to the earth and see what they have done to your Ten Commandments."<br>伍德羅．威爾遜一九一三年到一九二一年任美國總統。一九一七年，他率領美國加入第一次世界大戰，並於次年一月發表十四點方案，作交戰國議和綱領，力促成立國際聯盟。<br>根據一流行傳說，威爾遜一九二四年去世之後，上了天堂，碰見摩西。摩西問：「你是伍德羅．威爾遜先生吧？」「不錯。」摩西說：「我真替你難過。」威爾遜問：「為什麼？」「因為他們把你的十四點方案摧殘得體無完膚。」威爾遜回答說：「講到這個，我認為你應回到地球，看看他們把你的十誡弄成什麼樣子。」<br>*威爾遜的十四點方案發表之後，各國表面贊同，其實各有盤算。國際聯盟一九二零年成立，卻無力阻止第二次世界大戰，一九四六年正式解散。</p></body></html>
