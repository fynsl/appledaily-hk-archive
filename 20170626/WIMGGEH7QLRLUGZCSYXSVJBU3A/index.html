Lincoln journeyed to the front to inspect Union defences.  The task of showing him around fell to young Oliver Holmes, aide to the commanding general.<br>When Holmes pointed out the enemy in the distance, Lincoln, with his high plug hat, stood up to look.  A snarl of musketry fire came from the enemy trenches. Grabbing the president by the arm, Holmes dragged him under cover, shouting,  "Get down, you fool!"  When he realised what he had said, he was sure that disciplinary action would be taken.  But to his great relief, Lincoln said to him in an amused tone just before leaving,  "Goodbye, Captain Holmes.  I'm glad to see you know how to speak to a civilian."<br>美國南北戰爭期間，南軍一八六四年七月犯史蒂文斯堡。林肯赴前線視察北軍防務。戰地指揮官手下副官是個年輕人，叫奧立佛．霍姆茲，奉命帶領林肯四處視察。<br>霍姆茲遙指敵軍所在處，林肯就站起來看，頭上還戴着高頂禮帽。敵軍戰壕馬上火槍亂響。霍姆茲一手抓住林肯的手臂，把他扯到掩護物之後，喝道：「笨蛋，伏下來！」說罷，才想到自己是跟總統說話，以為一定會受到紀律處分。不料林肯離去時，以帶笑的語氣對他說：「霍姆茲上尉，再見。我很高興你懂得怎樣跟非戰鬥人員說話。」霍姆茲這才放下心頭大石。</p></body></html>
