Because of his skill in the courtroom, he rose rapidly in his profession.<br>Once, he defended a man charged with threatening another man's life.  When the plaintiff took the stand, Buchanan asked him:  "Well, sir, suppose you were a man of more nerve, a man not easily frightened by threats  -- put yourself in the position of a courageous man  -- would you have cared for the threat of my client?"  "I am a man," replied the plaintiff,  "of as much courage as anybody, sir."  "Then," said Buchanan, "you were not frightened when my client threatened you?"  "No, sir."  "You are not afraid of him?"  "No, I am not."  "Well, then what did you bring this charge for?  I move its dismissal."  The court at once dismissed the case.<br>詹姆斯．布坎南一八五七年到六一年任美國總統。他最初是律師，由於法庭上表現出色，在法律界迅速冒起。<br>有一次，一個男人被控恐脅另一個男人的性命，布坎南為之辯護，待原告走到證人席上，就問道：「先生，假如你較為勇敢，不輕易因恐嚇而害怕，換言之，假如你是個膽大的漢子，會不會把被告的恐嚇放在心上？」原告回答說：「先生，我的膽子不比他人小。」布坎南說：「那麼，被告恐嚇你的時候，你沒有感到害怕吧？」「沒有，先生。」「你不怕被告嗎？」「不怕。」「那麼，你為什麼提出控告？我建議法庭不受理這案件。」法庭馬上宣布案件不受理。</p></body></html>
