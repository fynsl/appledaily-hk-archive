Roosevelt found Stalin stiff, cold, and uncommunicative.  For three days he failed to cut through Stalin's icy reserve.<br>Then, on the fourth day, before discussions commenced, Roosevelt put on a chummy air and, lifting his hand to cover a whisper, said to Stalin, "Winston is cranky this morning, he got up on the wrong side of the bed."① A vague smiled passed over Stalin's eyes.  As soon as they sat down at the conference table, Roosevelt began to tease Churchill about his Britishness, about John Bull,②about his cigar, about his habits.  Churchill got red and scowled, and the more he did so, the more Stalin smiled.  Finally he broke into a hearty guffaw, and, laughing, shook hands with Roosevelt.<br>一九四三年，羅斯福、邱吉爾在德克蘭與斯大林會議。羅斯福發覺斯大林表現生硬冷漠，沉密寡言，頭三天都無法改變斯大林這種拒人千里的態度。<br>到了第四天，商議開始之前，羅斯福裝出熟落的樣子，以掌遮唇，低聲跟斯大林說：「老邱今早下牀躓仆，脾氣不好。」斯大林雙目微露笑意。三人才在會議桌前坐下，羅斯福就拿邱吉爾取笑，笑其英國脾性，笑約翰牛②，笑其雪茄，笑其習慣。邱吉爾氣得臉都紅了，怒形於色。而他越氣，斯大林越是忍俊不禁，終於縱聲大笑，還笑着跟羅斯福握手。<br>① 據十九世紀迷信說法，「起牀在不恰當的一方」（to get up on the wrong side of the bed），當日就會事事不如意，心情也不會好。<br>②約翰牛（John Bull）是十八世紀一首諷刺詩的主角，是個紅臉胖子。John Bull後來就成為英國人的綽號。</p></body></html>
