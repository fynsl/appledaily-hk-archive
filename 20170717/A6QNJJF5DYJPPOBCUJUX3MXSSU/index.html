Horrified, people nearby grabbed the assassin and pinned him to the floor.  McKinley slumped into a chair, looked up, and cried,  "Don't let them hurt him."  Then, gasping, he said to his secretary:  "My wife -- be careful, Cortelyou, how you tell her --  oh, be careful!"  As he was being carried to a hospital nearby, he sighed:  "It must have been some poor misguided follow."*<br>On 14 September, when it was clear that the end was near, McKinley repeated some lines from his favourite hymn,  "Nearer, my God, to Thee."  He then embraced his wife, who exclaimed,  "I want to go, too."  "We are all going,  " murmured McKinley.  They were his last words.<br>一九零一年九月六日，馬京利總統在水牛城與民眾見面。一個無政府主義者走近，朝他腹部連開兩槍。附近的人大驚，抓住刺客，按在地上。馬京利倒在一張椅子上，抬起頭，喊道：「叫他們別傷害他。」然後，他喘着氣，跟秘書說：「科特柳，告訴我妻子時，可得小心點，啊，得小心點。」他被送去附近一所醫院，路上歎息說：「那人一定是個可憐的糊塗蟲。」*<br>九月十四日，大限眼看已到，馬京利背誦了所愛聖歌《上帝漸近》的幾句，然後把妻子摟在懷中。他妻子說：「我也要去。」馬京利低聲說：「大家都會去的。」這是他最後說的一句話。<br>* 馬京利死後，那刺客也被處死。</p></body></html>
