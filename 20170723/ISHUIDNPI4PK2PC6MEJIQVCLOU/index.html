On the way they came to an overflowing creek and a rickety bridge.<br>"Do you think it safe, Ulysses?"  asked Julia.  "Why, of course it's safe," said Grant.  "Oh, I'm afraid,"  said Julia.  "Now, now, don't be frightened,"  said Grant.  "I'll take care of you."  "I'm going to cling to you," she said,  "no matter what happens,"  and she clasped his arm with both hands.<br>After they got safely across the bridge, Grant was silent for a moment.  He then turned to Julia and said,  "How would you like to cling to me for the rest of your life?"  They were married in August 1848.<br>攸里西斯．格蘭特還未出任美國南北戰爭之中北軍最高指揮官的時候，有一天和他追求的女郎朱莉雅．登特共乘馬車，來到一座搖搖晃晃的橋前，橋下河水正值暴漲。<br>朱莉雅問：「攸里西斯，這座橋安全嗎？」格蘭特說：「啊，當然安全。」朱莉雅說：「我很害怕。」格蘭特說：「不用怕，不用怕，我會照顧你。」朱莉雅兩手抓着格蘭特的手臂，說道：「不管怎樣，我會緊依着你。」<br>他們安然過橋之後，格蘭特沉默了一會，轉頭對朱莉雅說：「你以後都緊依着我，好嗎？」他們一八四八年八月結婚。</p></body></html>
