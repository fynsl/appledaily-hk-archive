"We shall have to see the president about that," said Stanton.  "All right," said Grant.  "The president ranks us both."<br>They went to the White House.  "Won't you state your case, General Grant?"  said Stanton.  Replied Grant:  "I have no case to state; I am satisfied as it is."  Stanton then stated his case.<br>Said Lincoln:  "You and I, Mr Stanton, have been trying to boss this job, and we have not succeeded very well with it.  We have therefore asked Mr Grant to relieve us, and I think we had better leave him alone to do as he pleases."<br>Grant finally defeated the Confederate army.<br>攸里西斯．格蘭特獲委任為美國北軍最高指揮官之後，有一次，戰爭部長愛德溫．斯坦頓大模大樣，要他解釋所下的一道命令。<br>格蘭特心平氣和說道：「部長，在南北戰事上，我職權應比你高。」斯坦頓說：「這個嗎，我們去問總統吧。」格蘭特說：「好，總統職權比我們兩人都要高。」<br>他們去到白宮。斯坦頓說：「格蘭特將軍，你有什麼要說，請說好嗎。」格蘭特回答說：「我沒什麼要說。我認為目前一切很好。」斯坦頓於是把他要說的說了一遍。<br>林肯說：「斯坦頓先生，我和你都曾經指揮戰事，卻未見成功，因此邀請格蘭特先生代勞。他想怎麼辦，我們最好不要干涉。」<br>格蘭特終於擊敗南軍。</p></body></html>
