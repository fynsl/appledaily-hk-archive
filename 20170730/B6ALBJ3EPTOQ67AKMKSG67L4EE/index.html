The emperor smiled cynically:  "Hm!  Of course she knows that her hair will come in longer and thicker for being cropped."<br>*　　　　　*　　　　　*<br>A widower in his great bereavement expressed his feelings by having engraved on his wife's tombstone the line, "My light has gone out."  Later, as he was about to marry again, he asked Bishop Henry Potter* whether or not he should have the inscription erased.  "Oh, no,"  said the bishop,  "just put underneath it,  'I have struck another match.'"<br>寶琳．波拿巴是拿破崙的妹妹，其丈夫勒克萊爾將軍非其所愛。勒克萊爾死後，她殮以名貴棺材，並剪下雲鬟陪葬。有人跟拿破崙國王說：「這樣向亡夫致意，真令人感動。」拿破崙哂笑說：「嘿，她當然知道，頭髮剪短之後，會長得更加長，更加濃密。」<br>*　　　　　*　　　　　*<br>某人為表喪妻之痛，在妻子墓碑上刻下一行字：「光明捨我從茲去。」後來，他準備再婚，就去見亨利．波特主教，問要不要把那行字抹去。波特說：「啊，不必。你只須在其下加上一句：『卻喜新添火種來。』」<br>*波特是美國聖公會主教，一九零八年去世。</p></body></html>
