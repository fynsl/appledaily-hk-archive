It took a full day to make the trip, so three meals were served on the boat.<br>At breakfast on one of his crossings, he asked the steward to keep a record of his expenses and collect payment for them at the end of the trip.  The steward hesitated, shifted from one foot to the other, and finally blurted cut:  "Damn sorry, sir, but when the last boat was torpedoed the passengers got drowned.  We may be sunk any moment, so I must collect after each meal."<br>美國參與第一次世界大戰之前，一九二九年將成為美國總統的赫伯特．胡佛負責比利時救濟工作，多次橫渡倫敦與比利時之間的英倫海峽。由於船行要一整天時間，三餐都在船上吃。<br>有一次，他在船上吃早餐，請服務員記帳，待抵岸時一併付款。那服務員面露難色，有點站立不安，終於直言不隱：「對不起，先生，但是，上次有船遭魚雷炸沉，乘客都淹死了。我們隨時都可能遇襲沉沒，所以，每頓飯之後，必須馬上收費。」<br>*Shift是「轉移」，to shift from one foot to the other直譯是「由一隻腳轉至另一隻腳」，即身體重心置於左脚又不是，右腳又不是，是不安的表現。</p></body></html>
