As Jefferson had some experience with surgery, he went to see the wounded man at once and soon had sewed up and bandaged the wound.  He then remarked that, while the ways of Divine Providence were wise, it was strange that the fleshy coverings of the bones in the limbs of the human frame were placed in the rear when the danger of their injury usually came from the front.<br>Not long after Jefferson left, David Stuart, a Federalist with an abiding hatred of Jefferson, came for a visit.  Hearing what Jefferson had done and said, he cried in horror:  "What is this world coming to?  Here this fellow, Jefferson, after turning upside down everything on this earth, is now quarrelling with God himself!"<br>有一天，美國第三任總統傑佛遜正在朋友威廉．菲茨休家中作客，一個僕人跑來說，有個黑人用斧頭砍傷小腿，傷勢嚴重。傑佛遜稍識外科手術，馬上去看傷者，不久就把傷口縫合並用繃帶包紮好。他說，上帝之道固然神妙，但人體四肢包裹骨骼的厚肉不長於前而長於後，頗為奇怪，因為創傷的危險多來自前方。<br>傑佛遜告辭之後不久，大衞．斯圖亞特到訪。他是聯邦黨員，恨傑佛遜入骨，聽到傑佛遜剛才所為及所言，慘然說道：「這個世界怎麼了？傑佛遜那傢伙已經把地球弄得翻天覆地，現在甚至要和上帝過不去！」</p></body></html>
