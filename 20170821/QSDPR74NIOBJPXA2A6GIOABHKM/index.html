When Jefferson said he was willing to live his life over again,  Adams replied:  "I have had a father and lost him.  I have had a mother and lost her.  I have had a wife and lost her.  I have had children and lost them.  I have had honourable and worthy friends and lost them - and instead of suffering these griefs again, I had rather go forward and meet my destiny."<br>In  1826, in reply to a visitor's question about his health, the  90-year-old man said, 　"I have lived in this old and frail tenement a great many years;  it is very much dilapidated;  and, from all that I can learn, my landlord doesn't intend to repair it."*<br>約翰．亞當斯曾協助草擬《美國獨立宣言》，後來還成為美國第二任總統。他晚年和湯瑪斯．傑佛遜通信甚頻。傑佛遜嘗言願意再活一次，亞當斯回答說：「我曾有父親，今已失去；曾有母親，今已失去；曾有妻子，今已失去；曾有孩子，今已失去；曾有可敬可親的朋友，今已失去。與其再次經歷這些傷心事，我寧願向前走，不避死亡。」<br>一八二六年，有訪客問九十歲的亞當斯健康怎樣，他說：「我在這破舊宅中住了多年，此宅已是頹敗不堪，據我所知，業主也無意修葺了。」*<br>*亞當斯、傑佛遜二人，都在一八二六年美國獨立五十周年紀念日去世。</p></body></html>
