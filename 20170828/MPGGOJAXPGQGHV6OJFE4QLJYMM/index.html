As Washington interrogated the settlers and hunters in the region in detail, Gallatin suddenly pointed impatiently to the only pass on the map that seemed practicable and cried: "Oh, it is plain enough!"<br>The room became silent. Washington himself paused, laid down his pen, and, obviously offended, looked up sternly at the young man for a moment. Then he resumed his inquiries. But after a few minutes he stopped abruptly, threw down his pen, and, looking at Gallatin, announced: "You are right, sir!" Reflected Gallatin later: "It was so on all occasions with General Washington. He was slow in forming an opinion, and never decided until he knew he was right."<br>阿伯特‧加勒廷是美國早期政壇人物，有一次出席會議，主席是喬治‧華盛頓，旨在擇一山口，築路穿過阿勒格尼山脈。華盛頓向當地居民及獵人細問情況，加勒廷很不耐煩，突然指着地圖上看來唯一實際可行的山口，高聲說：「啊，這還不清楚！」<br>房間裏一時鴉雀無聲。華盛頓也停下來，放下筆，一臉不悅神情，擡頭冷冷望了望這個年輕人，然後繼續問訊，但幾分鐘之後，就突然停止，拋下手中筆，望着加勒廷說：「加勒廷先生，你說得對！」加勒廷後來回憶說：「華盛頓將軍向來都是這樣，不倉卒拿定主意，要清楚知道自己沒有錯，才會下決定。」</p></body></html>
