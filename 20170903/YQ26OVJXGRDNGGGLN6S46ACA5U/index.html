He became the tenth president of the United States.<br>Tyler had been chosen by the Whigs to run for Vice-President, but after becoming president he alienated the Whigs by vetoing one bill after another passed by the Whigs in Congress.  He was eventually expelled from the Whig Party.  Once, he decided to take a trip and sent his son Bob to order a special train. The railroad superintendent, a devout Whig, told Bob that he did not run special trains for presidents.  "What!"  cried Bob, "didn't you furnish a special train for the funeral of President Harrison?"  "Yes," said the superintendent.  "And if you will bring your father here in that shape, you shall have the best train on the road!"*<br>一八四一年，美國副總統約翰．泰勒正在家裏和兒子玩彈珠，忽然接到總統哈里森的死訊。他成為美國第十任總統。<br>泰勒是獲自由黨提名參選副總統的，但當上總統之後，卻多次否決自由黨在國會通過的法案，最後被逐出黨。有一次，他準備去旅遊，遣兒子鮑伯去預定一列特別火車。鐵路局長是個忠實自由黨員，告訴鮑伯說，不會為總統安排特別火車。鮑伯愕然說：「怎麼？你們不是為哈里森總統的葬禮安排特別火車嗎？」鐵路局長回答說：「不錯。只要你用同一形式把令尊送來，我保證給你們安排全國最好的火車！」*<br>*這位鐵路局長，生於新中國，不槍斃，也應終身監禁。</p></body></html>
