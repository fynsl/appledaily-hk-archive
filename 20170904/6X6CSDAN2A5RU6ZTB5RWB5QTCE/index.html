"But I must tell you," he said frankly,  "that he voted against you."  "If he lost a leg fighting for his country," said Jackson,  "that is vote enough for me."<br>There was also a clergyman who called on Jackson several times seeking a federal appointment.  "Are you not a Christian minister?"  Jackson finally asked him.  "I am."  "Well," said Jackson,  "if you discharge the duties of that office, which is better than any I can confer, you will have no time for any other."<br>安德魯．傑克遜在對英國的一八一二年戰爭之中，成為美國國家英雄，一八二九年出任美國總統。<br>有人曾訪傑克遜，為一士兵說項：那士兵在戰場上失了一條腿，現在為了家計，盼能保有一小郵局的局長職位。說項者直言：「但我得告訴你，那士兵投票給你的對手。」傑克遜說：「他為國上戰場，失掉一條腿，那對我來說就是可貴的一票。」<br>又有一個牧師多次往訪傑克遜，盼獲聯邦政府職位，最後，傑克遜問他說：「你是做牧師的吧？」「不錯。」傑克遜說：「你那個職位，比我能給你的任何職位都要好。假如你履行職責，那裏還有時間兼顧其他工作？」</p></body></html>
