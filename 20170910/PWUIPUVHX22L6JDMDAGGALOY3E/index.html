After the battle, Jackson put in jail a local editor who had attacked him in his newspaper.  The editor appealed to federal judge Dominick Hall and obtained a writ of habeas corpus.  Jackson then had the judge jailed too.  But as soon as Jackson lifted martial law, Hall returned to his bench and summoned Jackson before him on a contempt citation.  Jackson appeared and paid a $1,000 fine.<br>As Jackson left the courtroom, he was surrounded by an angry crowd eager to avenge him.  But Jackson silenced them, saying, "Considering obedience to the laws, even when we think them unjustly applied, as the first duty of a citizen, I did not hesitate to comply with the sentence, and I entreat you to remember the example."<br>一八一五年，安德魯．傑克遜扼守新奧爾良，大敗英軍，成為美國軍事英雄。戰後，他把當地一編輯抓入獄：那編輯曾在其報紙上抨擊傑克遜。聯邦法官多米尼克．霍爾應那編輯之請，發出人身保護令，傑克遜就把霍爾也抓入獄。但是，傑克遜解除軍事管制之後，霍爾復職，以藐視法庭罪名，把傑克遜傳召上庭，罰款一千元。<br>傑克遜離開法庭時，憤怒的群眾把他包圍，要為他報復。傑克遜叫他們靜下來，說道：「我認為公民首先要守法，即使我們認為執法者不公道。因此，我毫不猶豫服從判決，希望大家以此為榜樣。」</p></body></html>
