Methodist evangelist Peter Cartwright was preaching, and one of the other preachers, Brother Mac, tugged at Cartwright's coat and whispered,　"General Jackson has come in."  Cartwright cried aloud indignantly,　"Who is General Jackson?  If he doesn't get his soul converted, God will damn him!"  After the service, Brother Mac rushed over to Jackson's hotel to apologise for Cartwright's remarks.<br>An hour or two later, Jackson ran into Cartwright on the street.  With a smile he said,　"Mr Cartwright, you are a man after my own heart.  A minister of Jesus Christ ought to love everybody and fear no mortal man.  If I had a few thousand such fearless officers as you were, and a well drilled army, I could take old England!"<br>安德魯．傑克遜在一八一二年戰爭之中，擊敗英軍，成為美國軍事英雄。戰後不久的一個星期天，他走進教堂，循道公會巡迴傳道者彼得．卡特賴特正在講道。另一講道者麥克修士扯扯卡特賴特的上衣，低聲說：「傑克遜將軍走了進來。」卡特賴特憤然高聲說：「誰是傑克遜將軍？他不誠心向道，上帝就會要他下地獄！」禮拜之後，麥克修士連忙走到傑克遜下榻的旅館，為卡特賴特向傑克遜道歉。<br>一、兩小時之後，傑克遜在街上碰到卡特賴特，微笑說道：「卡特賴特先生，我欣賞你這樣的人。耶穌基督的牧師，應博愛眾人，對任何人都無所畏懼。只要有幾千個你這樣的人做軍官，加上一支訓練有素的軍隊，我連英國都可以拿下來。」</p></body></html>
