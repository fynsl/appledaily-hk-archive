A young man, fresh from West Point and wearing his uniform, entered the place and sat down at his table.  "Well, old man,"  he asked,  "how are the Indians now?"  "I believe, sir,"  Taylor replied,  "that they are giving considerable trouble."  "Have a glass of beer with me, old codger, you and your neighbours.  I am an army officer and on my way to report for duty."  Taylor and his companions rose, toasted the young man, and left.<br>A day or so later, when the young man reported for duty, he was horrified to see the old codger in a colonel's uniform and apologised profusely.  "My young friend,"  said Taylor,  "never judge a stranger by his clothes."<br>一八三五至四二年的佛羅里達戰爭，是美軍與塞米諾爾印第安人之戰。戰爭期間，扎卡里．泰勒上校有一次身穿便裝短上衣，頭戴闊邊草帽，在一酒家稍歇，喝杯啤酒。一個少年剛從西點軍校畢業，身穿軍服，走了進來，在泰勒的桌子前坐下，問道：「老頭子，那些印第安人現在怎樣？」泰勒回答說：「先生，他們帶來麻煩不少。」「老頭子，還有你的同伴，跟我喝杯啤酒吧。我是軍官，現在正去報到。」泰勒和同伴站起來，向那少年敬酒，然後離去。<br>過了一天左右，那少年到軍中報到，見那老頭子身穿上校制服，惶恐謝罪。泰勒說：「小兄弟，以後碰到不相識者，不要看其衣着判斷其人。」</p></body></html>
