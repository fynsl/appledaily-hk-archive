Tucker instructed Adams to stay below if there was any fighting en route.  But no sooner had he sighted an enemy ship and engaged it in battle than Adams rushed up to the deck with a musket in his hand, ready to do his part. Tucker peremptorily ordered him below and then left to direct the engagement.<br>An hour or so later he discovered Adams still at his post, diligently firing away at the enemy.  "Why are you here, sir?"  he cried angrily.  "I am commanded by the Continental Congress to carry you safely to Europe, and I will do it!"  With that, he seized Adams in his arms and forcibly carried him off from the scene of danger.<br>一七七八年二月，美國獨立戰爭期間，約翰．亞當斯登上一艘快速艦，準備赴法國，作美國在巴黎的代表。船長塔克吩咐他說，途中假如發生戰鬥，要留在船艙裏。但是，塔克望見敵艦，才與之開戰，亞當斯已跑到甲板上，手執火槍，準備對敵。塔克厲聲命令他返回船艙，然後掉頭去指揮戰事。<br>過了一小時左右，塔亞看見亞當斯還留守崗位，忙着向敵人開槍，憤然喝道：「老兄，你怎麼還在這裏？我奉了大陸議會命令，要送你平安到達歐洲。我答應了，就做得到！」他說罷，兩手抱着亞當斯，強行把他拖離險地。</p></body></html>
