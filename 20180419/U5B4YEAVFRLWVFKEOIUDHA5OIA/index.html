The hidden location puzzled a lot of customers, it actually added to the sense of finding the sacred place in a pilgrimage. When you finally got the shop, it was like seeing the light in a dark night. And it was where all the magic begun.<br>Saito san is not an innovator in my opinion but rather an executor who exercise his craft in perfection. His beautiful form of sushis remain consistently the same over the years. The shape and curve did not change. The sequence was more or less the same as 7 or 10 years ago. He refuses to add truffle or caviars was he said to him it was no longer sushi. His view of good sushis is very straightforward - it is about balance of neta and shari and the chemistry of all things involved. If you are his long time customers, you will find a strong sense of stability and consistency and for me it is a strength that not many sushi chefs, even masters, can compete at his level.<br>That is not to say nothing changed at Sushi Saito now compared to Sushi Saito 7 years ago. When in the carpark the sushi shop was cozy and intimate and it gave you the feeling of enjoying an edomae art. Even the color of the light was different back then, more blue and “cold”, a tone of showing the relationship of chef and customers with an hierarchy, if that made sense.<br>In the new Roppongi building, the bigger, brighter room demonstrated Sushi Saito’s coming into the more modern world. The more yellowish light allows guests to feel the more casual, cheerful atmosphere. The light grey plate is more urban and stylish compared to the old clay like plate in brownish hue. It is sharper and more energetic, which fits with Saito san’s personality.<br>Saito san has a glowing charm that is hard to beat. He always carries a big smile and burst into laughters with talking with customers. He always amazes me with his raser sharp precision in neta cutting and nigiri making while he is interacting with customers. A lot of customers love him because there is no gap in sushi taisho and guests, there is no noticeable level of authority.<br>In the Roppongi shop, the most significant difference came with the second guest room next to the main dining room where Saito san serves his customers. At the beginning it was a waiting room for customers who came early while Saito san was finishing up his first dinner service. For about 2 years now it has become a second service room where sous chefs of Sushi Saito serve real customers using the same ingredients as the main room. It is a symbol of the start of Sushi Saito’s empire, one that was not obvious at the time but now makes so much sense in retrospect (more to come in next chapter).<br>While Saito san did not try to recreate a new style of sushi on his own, that’s not to say there were no changes in his sushi over time. Because the world has changed, the perception of people of having sushi changed. The changes he made were responses to changes in environments, fish condition, and as a result enhancements to make his sushi maintaining the same level of balance every day.<br>In the past abalone and octopus were two staples at Sushi Saito that appeared on the same dish as the second otsumami (appetizers). These days the supply of abalone and price fluctuate largely and one may not see it appearing in the lineup.<br>Katsuo (bonito) used to be served as a “zuke” (漬け, marinated in soy mixture) with scallions and ginger. The sheen of on the darker red flesh and shiny silver skin gave you a luscious feel even before you eat. Now it is served as tataki style, the outside surface is grilled first so you will see a rim of whiter flesh between the ruby red flesh and charred skin.<br>Saba Bozushi (Mackerel Stick Sushi), one of my favorite sushi at Saito, had thick ratio of fatty saba lined with kombu on top was rolled with small amount of sushi rice and shiso (perilla leaves) and dusted with sesame seeds. It used be served on plate with two wedges of bettara pickles, but now it is served hand to hand with the saba boshi tucked into crispy seaweed.<br>Saito san will create new otsumami every now and then. From the saba bozushi he made a version using iwashi in summer. I was among the first session of customers to try it and he asked whether it was delicious. And with a big smile of satisfaction I think he got the answer but I still has to say to him, “Please put it in the regular menu when iwashi is in season”. And there went a whole summer with this wonderful sushi.<br>He changed the sugar used in the tamago (玉子,Egg) from granulated sugar to wasanbon 和三盆糖 which gave the egg a more dull color but more elegant taste.<br>He also prepared other new dishes such as grilled hokkigai (北寄貝 surf clams) topped with dehydrated aosanori (a type of seaweed) which appeared two times this year. These creations tend to pop up for a short time. I think it is his way to respond to the ever changing offering in the fish market when the price of certain staples get out of balance. Remember Saito san’s philosophy is all about balance.<br>The introduction of Futomaki (太巻 big roll) showed Saito san’s strong sense of understanding customers’ flavor profile. Back in the old days when Saito san’s customers comprised of mainly sushi purists, the traditional set of nigiri is more than enough to satisfy. Saito san’s rising global stardom means guests from all over the world with very different backgrounds come to experience his sushi. At first I failed to appreciate its significance because I thought futomaki is such a peasant roll to enjoy. But after I tried a few times I realized it epitomized Saito san’s ultimate philosophy: balance of 7 ingredients that all worked in harmony and turned in unison. I crave for this sushi now and when other sous chefs at the shop make it, it does not taste the same.<br>There are even more significant changes that just happened in February and March of the year. The soul of sushi making, the shari, has been changed. When I visited Saito san on April 2, he mentioned to us that he has changed the rice from “Akita Komachi”あきたこまち from Akita to “Koshihikari” コシヒカリfrom Fukushima. He has also changed his water system to create a smoother soft water for cooking the rice. My friend who went with me that night happened to be a fanatic on water to cook rice and he had experimented with different level of hard and soft water which resulted in very significant difference in the cooked rice. In April visit I could certainly detect the softer rice compared to before and less rice grain individual texture as a whole. It will probably take me a few visits to get accustomed to the new rice.<br>Changes in Sushi Saito may sometimes be random but mostly calculated, in a way to cope with the changing world and to get better. If you love someone you will accept and embrace their changes. And so did I.</p><p>ig : little_meg_siu_meg<br><br>撰文：小瑪姬<br>編輯：彭錦明</p></body></html>
