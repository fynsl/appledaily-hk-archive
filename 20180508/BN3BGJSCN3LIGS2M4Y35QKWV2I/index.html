I know it is not easy!<br>Above all I am like you, I am an Arsenal fan.<br>That means this is more than just watching football it is a way of life. It is about caring about the beautiful game, about the values that we cherish and as well that something that goes through every cell of our bodies we care, we worry, we are desperate but when you come here dreams are realised.<br>I would like to thank everybody at the club which makes the club so special.<br>I would invite you to really push to support these players and the staff which remains behind me.<br>For me this group of players have a special quality not just on the pitch but off the pitch.<br>And please follow this team and really support this team next season because they really deserve it.<br>I would like to finish with one simple word: I will miss you.<br>Thank you for being such an important part of my life and I hope to see you soon. Well done. Bye bye."</p></body></html>
